                        <br>
                        <h6>
                            <p>I'm a native speaker of Portuguese, speak English, I'm studying Italian and I live in a
                            country with three official languages, which means that eventually, I'll be learning the
                            other languages.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>I got to study a little German and every time I start studying a new language I struggle
                                with the variations of the verb.</p>

                            <p>I really need repetition to assimilate the information and after a lot of searching for a
                            site where I can simply choose a verb and practise all the variations,
                            I decided to do it myself.</p>


                            <p>At the moment this text is being written, we have the option for Italian and the database
                            already has more than 500 verbs, and growing.</p>

                            <p>English should be the second language, and then French, slowly and steadily.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>I hope the site is as useful to you as it is to me.
                            Your feedback is always welcome!</p>
